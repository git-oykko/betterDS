            Alright, let me explain what this is about, It's just a simple module and useful for saving data in Roblox <br>
            I think this should make it clear. Also, this site probably will never be released including the module to the public <br>
            Since, it just makes your code look clean and uses the default datastore. Unless, I manage to add some special features <br>
            This probably won't be released. Although, I think I will make this site public however this would be treated as a side project.

            This project and site has been originally made by Oykko. You can check the license in the License Tab.
