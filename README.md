# betterDS
A simple and useful datastore module for Roblox.

# About
It is an datastore module for which already protects your requests and restricts them if roblox is down.

This isn't really meant to be a project since it can be easily created. It just uses the default datastore functions and
wraps them in pcalls and retry 5 times at a interval since datastore requests accept requests per 6 seconds. It is just meant to make
our code look clean. "I will probably discontinue this side-project since I have better things to do. "- Oykko

This module probably will never be released including the module to the public
Since, it just makes your code look clean and uses the default datastore. Unless, I manage to add some special features
This probably won't be released. Although, I think I will make this site public however this would be treated as a side project.
